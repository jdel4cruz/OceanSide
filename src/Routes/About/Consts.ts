  "I needed a new project idea and I've always thought it'd be nice to retire and run a food truck or a cafe \
  on the beach in the future. So running with that idea, I decided to create a web application where users \
  can place food orders online for pickup.";

export const aboutBody2 =
  "Right off the bat I wanted to incorporate Redux, TypeScript, and Material UI into this project. \
The first two primarily cause they're desired quite a bit, and the last one to have another option for component \
styling other than Styled-Components which I'm very familiar with.";
export const aboutBody3 =
  "During the course of the project, I didn't really run into issues until I reached the checkout \
part of the application where I quickly realized that I had no idea how to set it up. After doing research for a few days,\
I settled on using stripe to handle my user payments. Prior to creating the checkout session, a form created with React-Hook-Form \
is used to collect user data, and that data is sent to a simple backend created with NodeJS and Express.";

export const aboutBody4 =
  "Overall I'm fairly happy with the project. I used the new things I set out to use, and learned extra stuff along the way. \
Design-wise, I still don't feel great about it but that'll come with time as I continue to work on more projects and look \
at other application designs as a reference. I likely will not add additional features to this project since as soon as \
I start adding scope creep to this project, it will never end since there are always thing that can be improved. I'd prefer \
anything else I want to learn I'll just incorporate in a future project instead.";

export const aboutClose =
  "If you read up to this part that means you managed to get through the essay above. Thanks for checking my project out and I hope \
you have a good day!";
